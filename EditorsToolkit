6 Contribute - 08 Editors Toolkit

<p>The Editors Toolkit (>Action >View >Editors Toolkit) is a visualization and filtering tool that makes it easy to identify and fill gaps in the data for your crags.</p>

<p>You can toggle between 'Map' and 'Timeline' for different views of the data.</p>

<p>You can use the menu on the left to see, for example, how many routes at the crag don't yet have a description. Clicking on the menu item will filter the list to just those routes. From there you can click on 'Bulk Edit these routes' to create a customized form to fill in the missing data.</p>
