1 About theCrag - 1 Contact us - Bugs and new features

<p>We love <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a>! Github is a place where people can share open source code and track bugs and features requests.</p>
<p>Parts of theCrag are released as open source and github is where we will host that code. We are also using github's issue's tracker for all bugs and feature requests related to our general website.</p>
