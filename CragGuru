4 Climb - 3 Crag Guru explained

<p>There are three elements to the Crag Guru results that you see as you browse the index they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recommendations</li>
<li>Nearby Icons</li>
<li>Nearby Classics</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these is explained below.</p>


<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>Recommendations are the nearby routes that have been most often climbed and enjoyed by people with a similar type of climbing style and ability to you.</p>

<p>At a crag or area page, recommendations will be selected from all subordinate routes within that crag or area.</p>

<p>At a route page, recommendations will be drawn from all routes at the top level crag.</p>

<p>The quality of Crag Guru's recommendations for you improves as you log more ascents as this allows the guru to learn more about your climbing style and ability.


<h2>Nearby Icons</h2>

<p>An 'icon' is the best route at that grade in the area. Wherever you are in the index there can be only one icon route per grade.</p>

<p>Crag Guru determines iconic status based on a number of factors including number of ascents, quality ratings and desirability (how often the route is flagged on someone's hit-list).</p>

<p>Icons change as you navigate through the index. For example at a country level it shows the best route at each grade in the country, at the state or province level it shows the best route at each grade in the state or province. There is also a minimum threshold that a route must achieve in order to be considered an icon. This means that as you go lower in the index there might be some grades with no icon route or even no icon routes at any grade.</p>

<p>At a route page, icons will be drawn from all routes at the top level crag.</p>


<h2>Nearby Classics</h2>

<p>Classic are the highest quality routes. Crag Guru calculates these based on the quality assessments made by members who have logged ascents in the index (ie the same data that is used to assign stars to routes).</p>

<p>At a crag or area page, classics will be selected from all subordinate routes within that crag or area. At the crag or area level Crag Guru only shows classics that are at or below your current ability band (based on the ascents you have logged in the index). This means that people climbing at Beginner level will only be shown Beginner routes, people climbing at Experienced level will be shown Experienced, Intermediate and Beginner routes.</p>

<p>At a route page, classics will be selected from all routes at the top level crag that are within the same difficulty band.</p>
