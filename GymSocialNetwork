<h1>5 reasons for a gym to become part of theCrag network</h1>

<h2>Reason 1: Goodwill in your grass root members</h2>


<p>Even though they are not a particularly commercial demographic of your business, your hard-core grassroots climbers are the heart and soul of your business. They may only make up a small portion of your customers who come through the door, but they are advocates for your community. They know and influence dozens to hundreds of people, they talk about you, they create a vibe. Use them, reward them.</p>


<p>Get your gym routes onto theCrag so your grassroots members can record their training ticks.</p>


<h2>Reason 2: SEO benefits</h2>


<p>If you run a climbing gym, you would have been bombarded with tales of the importance of Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). No doubt your SEO service provider has told you that you need to be linked from reputable sources and you need activity on your website.</p>


<p>Get linked from theCrag.</p>


<h2>Reason 3: Increased activity on your social network</h2>


<p>Have you got a social network plan? If you don’t, you should. If you do get advice in this area then you will know that you need to be active in your social networks. Moreover this activity should be in line with the underlying message you want to convey to the climbing community.</p>


<p>Being part of theCrag will help you to be able to create activity for your social networks. We are happy to talk through some ideas.</p>


<p>Furthermore as people start logging ascents from your gym, our members have the option of automatically publishing these ascents on their Facebook page. This means your gym will be repeatedly mentioned in the fabric of people's Facebook walls without you doing anything.</p>


<h2>Reason 4: Increase return rate of new members</h2>


<p>One of the most important business metrics for running a successful gym is the return rate for new members (see article).</p>


<p>If new members of your gym can log their ascents and share them with their friends then this will increase the stickiness of this new member. They are either going to climb more often to achieve the next grade level or come back because they are proud of their achievements which are now recorded. The act of recording makes it more real for climbers.</p>


<p>General feedback on theCrag is that people climb more when they start logging their ascents on theCrag.</p>


<h2>Reason 5: Advertising and promotion on theCrag</h2>


<p>This is really the last and least important of the reasons because basically you can buy advertising using Google adwords and get lots of eyeballs for dollars.</p>


<p>When you buy advertising on theCrag you also get a nice branding opportunity in a strong climbing community in both web and print format. Your ads also go into our free PDF guidebooks. Neither of these come from Google AdWords.</p>


<p>That being said this is not a game changer for your business, but reasons 1 to 4 are. We are far more interested in building a long term relationship with rock climbing gyms to help them best participate in the community they serve. If you are an SEO adviser for a gym we are happy to work with you to best support your client.</p>


<h1>How does a rock climbing gym participate in theCrag</h1>


<p>For a rock climbing gym to fully participate in theCrag you have to take out a sponsorship package which starts at $100 per annum. Some features are only available for sponsors.</p>


<p>The following are tangible ideas of how to participate.</p>


<h2>Sponsor a region in theCrag</h2>


<p>Starting from $100 per annum you can sponsor a region containing your gym at theCrag.com. For that you get a directory listing, an allocation of sponsor banners shown at that region and below and your sponsor banner in the online PDFs created for crags under that region.</p>

<p>See article on <a href="/article/EntryLevelSponsorship">entry level sponsorship</a> for more information.</a>


<h2>Get your Gym added to our index</h2>


<p>Getting your gym created and located in the index is free. However if you want to do more with it then you will have to become a sponsor.</p>


<p>Sponsors will get editor rights to their gym node, which means they can control the descriptions, create walls and routes so that people can log ascents in your gym.</p>

<h2>Full gym partner ticking integration</h2>


<p>We have got many ideas for gyms, but need real environments with real business owners to test them.</p>
