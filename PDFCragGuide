<h1 id="printing">Tips for printing</h1>

<p>The PDF Crag Guides are designed to be printed as a folded booklet. This will save paper and make for a print-out that is easier to use when you're climbing. (If the directions below make it all sound too hard then of course it's fine to print it out any way you like.)</p>

<p>If you have a printer than can print double-sided:</p>

<ol>
<li>In Adobe Reader click on 'File' then select 'Print...'</li>
<li>In the 'Page Scaling' dropdown select 'Booklet Printing'</li>
<li>Check that 'Booklet Subset' is set to 'Both sides'</li>
<li>Ensure that double sided printing is selected under Printer Properties</li>
<li>Click 'OK' to print the document</li>
<li>The pages should come off the printer ready to be folded in half into a small booklet. You can put in a couple of staples to help hold it together.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have a printer than can print only single-sided:</p>

<ol>
<li>In Adobe Reader click on 'File' then select 'Print...'</li>
<li>In the 'Page Scaling' dropdown select 'Booklet Printing'</li>
<li>Under 'Booklet Subset' select 'Front side only'</li>
<li>Click 'OK' to print the document</li>
<li>Now comes the tricky bit. (You may have to experiment a couple of times with your printer to work out how to orient the paper). Take the pages that you've just printed and put them back into your printer's paper tray facing the other way so the printer will now print on the other side.</li>
<li>In Adobe Reader click on 'File' then select 'Print...'</li>
<li>In the 'Page Scaling' dropdown check that 'Booklet Printing' is still selected</li>
<li>Under 'Booklet Subset' select 'Back side only'</li>
<li>Click 'OK' to print the document.</li>
<li>The pages should now come off the printer ready to be folded in half into a small booklet. You can put in a couple of staples to help hold it together.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

<h2>Paper jam at step 9</h2>

<p>If at step 9 you find that you get paper jams as the printer tries to feed paper that it has already printed on one side, you may need to repeat steps 6-9 one page at a time (ie Select 'Sheets from 1 to 1', then 'Sheets from 2 to 2', etc).</p>

<h2>Pages come out with double printing on the one side or pages upside down at step 10</h2>

<p>This means that when you've put the pages in for the second lot of printing they were facing the wrong way in the paper tray. It might take a couple of tries to get this right, but is pretty easy once you've got the hang of it.</p>
