API

<p>thecrag.com will be releasing an Applicaton Programming Interface (API) to access and share rock climbing information in a programmatic way. For example you will be able to use this API to build your own iphone app, or present rock climbing information on your website.</p>

<p>Use of the API will broadly follow the sites copyright statement. Free to use for non-commercial use, but commercial use must be explicitly negotiated.</p>

<p>Please <a href="/article/contactus">contact us</a> if you want to register interest in the API.</p>
