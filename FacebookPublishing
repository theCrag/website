<p>Acents logged in www.thecrag.com may also be logged in your Facebook Wall. This service must be setup from www.thecrag.com and is selectable on a per ascent basis as you log an ascent.</p>

<p>To setup this service you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Log in to your thecrag.com account;</p></li>
  <li><p>Click on the Account Portal tab;</p></li>
  <li><p>Select 'Setup Facebook Publishing' button; and</p></li>
  <li><p>Follow prompts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note you will be asked by Facebook to grant the application (known as 'thecrag.com Publishing' on Facebook) permissions to publish on your wall. If you don't give the application permission then the service cannot be activated on your account.</p>


<h2>Logging Ascents</h2>

<p>Once setup, every time you log an ascent you will be given the option to tell the system to also post the ascent on your Facebook Wall. The ascent must have been made in the last 10 days.</p>

<p>If you are logging a single ascent then the copy of the post will be:</p>

<p>[Rock climbing/Bouldering] at thecrag. [Ticked/Onsighted...] [Climb] ([Grade]) at [Crag]: [COMMENT]. </p>

<p>If you are logging multiple shots for one climb then the copy of the post will be:</p>

<p>[Rock climbing/Bouldering] at thecrag. Climbed [SHOTS] shots of [CLIMB] at [AREA] on [DATE]: [SHOT#] - [COMMENT];</p>

<p>If you are logging multiple ascents for an area then you will be given the opportunity to select individually which ascents will be posted on you Facebook Wall. Posted ascents will have the same format as for logging a single ascent.</p>


<p>Posts will also have a link to a climb, so your friends will be able to see what you have climbed.</p>
