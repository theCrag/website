<p>Once you have connected your thecrag account with your Facebook account acents logged in thecrag.com may also be logged in your Facebook Wall. This service is selectable on a per ascent basis as you log an ascent.</p>

<h1>Logging Ascents</h1>
<p>Once setup, every time you log an ascent you will have the option post the ascent on your Facebook Wall. The ascent must have been made in the last 10 days.</p>

<p>The post for each ascent will look something like this:</p>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="offset1 span10 centering">
    <div class="sd-image-caption">
      <img src="/static/cids/images/fb-logging-example-1.1.0.gif" width="461" height="123"/>
