Web Designer Brief

<p>We need web design help for www.thecrag.com.</p>

<p>Currently our biggest issue is that we do not have a web designer to help with web page portal design.</p>

<p>Until we get  some web design help the site will look clunky. We have some ideas on what the main pages <a href="http://www.thecrag.com/doc/crag_mockup_04.pdf">should look like</a> and <a href="http://www.thecrag.com/doc/20091227 thecrag.com user scenarios.pdf">how it will be used</a>, but do not have the implementation skills required to make it all happen.</p>

<p>The web designer brief is to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Continue development of an existing CSS file;</p></li>
  <li><p>Implement sample pages for the following main portals in accordance with a pre-existing wire frame design:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Area page;</p></li>
      <li><p>Climb page;</p></li>
      <li><p>Account page;</p></li>
      <li><p>Crag guide page; and</p></li>
      <li><p>Trips page; and</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><p>Provide design inputs for the website.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>After a sample page has been developed we have processes to convert that to a generic template that will, for example, be used on all area pages. Effectively this means that the critical parts of the site can be implemented with 5 template pages. There are other pages, but these are of much lesser importance from a design perspective.</p>

<p>We have a pretty good idea of what the site could look like and have developed some power point wire frames to work towards. We have no money so cannot pay for now.</p>

<p>A sponsors page outlining the nature of contributions from major sponsors and those providing significant assistance will be added to the site. The web designers contribution would also be promoted on this page.</p>

<p>We imagine that the initial work will take about three weeks with an ongoing role as the site progresses. We would also do as much as we could to support and provide feedback if a student wanted to take it on as a industry experience project.</p>

<p>If you are a web designer (or studying to be one), want to help and have the time to put in then please contact us ( &#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116; &#64; thecrag.com ).</p>
