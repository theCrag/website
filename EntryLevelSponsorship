7 Business & sponsorship - 6 Entry level business sponsorship

<p>Sponsor a crag, region or country and you get a share of the advertising at all lower levels.</p>


<p>Sponsorship gives you a share of the advertising inventory in the web and printed PDF Crag Guides at all levels below your sponsored area. For example if you are a Gym, you can sponsor your home region, this means your ads will be shown on the site and in the printed Crag Guides for all crags in your local area.</p>


<p>The number of times your ad gets shown depends on how much you are paying. If you want to pay more, your ad will appear more often.</p>


<p>Your ads will link to your homepage, or another page you nominate.</p>

<p>You will need to provide two pieces of artwork for the banners. It is important to keep them in A4 dimensions, or else they might get cropped:</p>



<h2>1. PORTRAIT <small>(for in the PDF Guides)</small></h2>

<div class="sd-floater">
  <div class="sd-image-caption">
    <img class="sd-article-img" src="/static/cids/images/article-sponsor-1.1.0/thecrag-sponsor-pdf-example-small2.png" />
    <p>Ad in PDF Crag Guides</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A4 dimension image. Our biggest dimension is currently 1472 x 2080 pixels. Smaller dimensions will still work, but PDF image quality may suffer. If you give us an image about 50% bigger than our current biggest dimension then we will have really good resolution for the PDF Guides. Make sure you include a clear call to action (eg your web address or contact details), as some people will print these guides out.</p>


<p>Image format should be JPG or PNG.</p>



<h2>2. LANDSCAPE <small>(for on the website)</small></h2>

<div class="sd-floater">
  <div class="sd-image-caption">
    <img class="sd-article-img" src="/static/cids/images/article-sponsor-1.1.0/thecrag-sponsor-site-example-small2.png" />
    <p>Ad in website</p>
  </div>

<p>A4 dimension image. Or biggest landscape image is currently 230 x 162 pixels, but it is likely we will be using some bigger images soon. We recommend providing a similar size to the portrait image.</p>


<p>Image format should be JPG or PNG.</p>
