How to - About updating descriptions


<h2>Inherited Fields</h2>

<p>Routes and areas have several different description fields that may be edited, depending on the area type (see <a href="/article/areatypes">area types</a> article). Some of these fields (Ethic and Access) will be inherited from parent levels when browsing the index. This means you only have to put the ethic of a crag in once and it will be visible at all descendant areas.</p>


<h2>Markdown</h2>

<p>You can create simple text formating using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown convention</a>. Markdown formating allows you to display paragraphs, headings, lists, images and links.</p>


<h2>Copyright Attribution</h2>

<p>Normally when you enter a description it will be submitted under <a href="/processmap/copyright">thecrag.com copyright</a>. The system also allows for descriptions to be submitted under third party publishers copyright. In this case the attributed publisher will be the primary owner of the information and thecrag.com will be custodians of that information. thecrag.com will display and distribute the information as a <a href="/article/mixedcopyright">mixed copyright</a>, where the overall document has multiple copyrights and each piece of information a specific copyright.</p>

<p>In order to submit area and route descriptions attributed to a third party publisher that publisher must be set up correctly in the system. When set up there are two ways you can attribute new descriptions to another publisher:</p>

<ol>
<li>Publisher account</li>
<li>Working publication</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that all of these scenarios involve negotiation with the publisher, and administration set up in the system.</p>

<p>Also note that content attributed to a publisher is owned by the publisher not by thecrag.com.</p>

<h3>Publisher account</h3>

<p>If your account is set up as a publisher account then your copyright submissions are attributed to that publisher. When a copyright submission is made there will be a field showing the publisher copyright associated with the submission.</p>


<h3>Working publication</h3>

<p>If a publisher has agreed to have content from a particular publication entered into the system, then you may help with the data entry. To do this we will have to set up your account with a working publication. When set up, every time you enter an area or route description in the publication area you will have the option of attributing it to the publisher.</p>

<p>Even though the publisher has been attributed with the content you will get the <a href="/article/cragkarma">Crag Karma</a> points for the data entry.</p>



<h3>Public copyright</h3>

<p>If no publisher is set up for you to attribute then you will be submitting content under thecrag.com's copyright.</p>


<h3>Changing publisher</h3>

<p>There are times where descriptions from multiple publishers are available in an area or route. If the content is set to editable then you can update each of these separately by using the 'Select Another Publisher' button.</p>



<h2>Please respect copyright</h2>

<p>If thecrag.com does not have an agreement with the publisher, please respect the publishers copyright. We do not want unsolicited copyright material being added to the site - as well as being illegal it causes all sorts of headaches. You may however submit material based on your own experience and researching serveral guidebooks, but don't copy out of guidebooks.</p>
