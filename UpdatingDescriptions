The system accepts a wide range of grades, pretty much anything you would expect to see in a guidebook.</td>

<h2><a name="section3">3. Formatting</a></h2>

<p>thecrag allows some basic formatting inside of area and route descriptions. It is based on a very natural text format called Markdown with a few extra twists that we're calling "thecrag Flavored Markdown".</p>

<p>The examples below should show you almost everything you need to create great guides, but if you want more you can check out the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown Syntax Guide</a> at Daring Fireball.</p>


<h3>Adding paragraphs</h3>

<p>Hit 'Enter' twice to create a new paragraph.</p>

<div class="input">
<h2>Enter text like this:</h2>
<textarea>
Here is my first parapragh. When I get to the end I'll hit 'Enter' twice.

And then start my next paragraph.
</textarea>

</div>
</div>

&nbsp;<br>


<h3>Bulleted lists</h3>

<p>Use asterisks ('*') to make a bulleted list. The trick to bullet lists (and numbered lists) is you must leave a blank line before the first bullet point.</p>

<div class="input">
<h2>Enter text like this:</h2>
<textarea>
Look after the park:

* Stick to the paths
* Don't disturb wildlife
* Take all your rubbish away with you
</textarea>

<li>Take all your rubbish away with you</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

&nbsp;<br>



<h3>Numbered lists</h3>

<p>Use numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. You must leave a blank line before the first number item.</p>

<div class="input">

Start at the R end of the base of the buttress.

1. 43m (12) Up the slab (some fiddly pro) to L facing corner. Up corner to ramp. Belay at top of ramp.
2. 12m (12) Move around the arete, then up. Airy traverse L around the arete (grovel across or grab the undercling, lean back and find good holds above), and across the front face to belay on the nose.
3. 20m (12, crux) Diagonally R across the face to a bottomless chimney. Belay at the top of the chimney.

<h3>Internal links</h3>

<p>Enclose the name of a crag, area or route within double (or single) quotation marks and it will get turned into an internal link when that name appears on the same page. This form of markup is contextual in that it will only create links for descendant areas or routes in Crag Guide.</p>

Ironically, the Garra boulders area was discovered by accident by Rob Dixon and Brian Birchall whilst returning from a day at Nettle Buttress. The year was 1975. On this day they completed 'Hope' (16) and 'Charity' (14). Development continued through the following years with one of the best being the classic easy route 'Illusion' (13).

<h3>External links</h3>

<p>Links to external sites and email addresses will be automatically converted. However these should be kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>In most cases external links are only relevant to the web channel, so when we produce printed or iphone guides they become useless. It is better to bring content to the site then link to it so that the information can be properly distributed.</p>

<p>Also using this capability for blatant advertising is not permitted.<p>

<p>External links facility will be under ongoing review and may be discontinued if it is abused or no longer suites thecrag's longer term goals.</p>

<p>Note that the external web address must have whitespace on either side for this feature to work.</p>

<h2><a name="section4">4. Writing style</a></h2>

<p>A consistent approach to writing route descriptions makes for easier reading. Our thoughts on order and formatting of information within a route description are demonstrated below. Some crags and/or editors will have their own particular style and that's absolutely fine.</p>


<h3>Route descriptions</h3>

<p>The following is an example of a single pitch route description with comments on a standardised style.</p>

<div class="example" style="border:1px solid #000">

&nbsp;<br>

<div class="bubble"><div>
<strong>Spray: </strong>
 Subjective information that provides a bit of local colour.
</div></div>
<p class="target">One of the few Werribee routes that deserves the star it was given in the printed guide.</p>

<div class="bubble"><div>
<strong>Start/location: </strong>
 For a simple route this may be all that is needed (eg. "The crack 2m L of Bard").
</div></div>
<p class="target">Start 1m L of 'Barbara Streisand'.</p>
&nbsp;<br>

<div class="bubble"><div>
<strong>Detailed description: </strong>
 A fairly objective description of the route. May include information about the crux, gear required, etc.
</div></div>
<p class="target">Up to flake then straight up the middle of the face. Add points for style if you finish dierct over the middle of the overlap, otherwise finish up Vulcan.</p>
&nbsp;<br>

<div class="bubble"><div>
<strong>Descent: </strong>
 Usually only required if the descent of the route is different to the descent described in the area information for the cliff or sector.
</div></div>
<p class="target">Step R to descend from Barbara's chains.</p>
&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</div>


<h3>Multipitch routes</h3>

<p>The following is an example of a multipitch pitch route description with comments on a standardised style.</p>

<div class="example" style="border:1px solid #000">
&nbsp;<br>

<div class="bubble"><div>
<strong>Number list markdown: </strong>
 Use markdown formatting (see above) to create a numbered list.
</div></div>
<p class="target">Start at the R end of the base of the buttress.</p>
&nbsp;<br>

<div class="bubble"><div>
<strong>Pitch standard: </strong>
 If possible, start the description for each pitch with the pitch length and the the grade (in brackets).
</div></div>
<p class="target">
<ol>
<li><p>43m (12) Up the slab (some fiddly pro) to L facing corner. Up corner to ramp. Belay at top of ramp.</p></li>
<li><p>12m (12) Move around the arete, then up. Airy traverse L around the arete (grovel across or grab the undercling, lean back and find good holds above), and across the front face to belay on the nose.</p></li>
<li><p>20m (12, crux) Diagonally R across the face to a bottomless chimney. Belay at the top of the chimney.</p></li>
<li><p>15m (12) Up the steep juggy line to the Bard Terrace.</p></li>
<li><p>30m (12) Up the bottomless corner then R onto and up the wall.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

</div>


<h2><a name="section5">5. Attribution</a></h2>

<p>Normally when you enter a description it will be submitted under <a href="/processmap/copyright">thecrag.com copyright</a>. The system also allows for descriptions to be submitted under third party publishers copyright. In this case the attributed publisher will be the primary owner of the information and thecrag.com will be custodians of that information. thecrag.com will display and distribute the information as a <a href="/article/mixedcopyright">mixed copyright</a>, where the overall document has multiple copyrights and each piece of information a specific copyright.</p>

<p>In order to submit area and route descriptions attributed to a third party publisher that publisher must be set up correctly in the system. When set up there are two ways you can attribute new descriptions to another publisher:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Publisher account</li>
  <li>Working publication</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that all of these scenarios involve negotiation with the publisher, and administration set up in the system.</p>

<p>Also note that content attributed to a publisher is owned by the publisher not by thecrag.com.</p>


<h3>Publisher account</h3>

<p>If your account is set up as a publisher account then your copyright submissions are attributed to that publisher. When a copyright submission is made there will be a field showing the publisher copyright associated with the submission.</p>


<h3>Working publication</h3>

<p>If a publisher has agreed to have content from a particular publication entered into the system, then you may help with the data entry. To do this we will have to set up your account with a working publication. When set up, every time you enter an area or route description in the publication area you will have the option of attributing it to the publisher.</p>

<p>Even though the publisher has been attributed with the content you will get the <a href="/article/cragkarma">Crag Karma</a> points for the data entry.</p>


<h3>Public copyright</h3>

<p>If no publisher is set up for you to attribute then you will be submitting content under thecrag.com's copyright.</p>


<h3>Changing publisher</h3>

<p>There are times where descriptions from multiple publishers are available in an area or route. If the content is set to editable then you can update each of these separately by using the 'Select Another Publisher' button.</p>


<h2><a name="section6">6. Please respect copyright</a></h2>

<p>If thecrag.com does not have an agreement with the publisher, please respect the publishers copyright. We do not want unsolicited copyright material being added to the site - as well as being illegal it causes all sorts of headaches. You may however submit material based on your own experience and researching several guidebooks, but don't copy out of guidebooks.</p>
