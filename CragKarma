<h2>Introducing Crag Karma</h2>


<p>Crag Karma is a way of thecrag recognising user contributions to the index.
</p>
<p>Every time you contribute to the index, you are helping to build and improve this free online guide for the benefit of the whole climbing community.
</p>
<p>Karma points are added up across the index to give you a score for each area, up to the World level at the top of the index.
</p>
<p>Each contribution will add to your Karma points. You currently get points for the following: *

% my $karma = $ARGS{data}->{karma};

<table>
% foreach my $activity ( sort {$karma->{$b}<=>$karma->{$a}} keys %{$karma} )   {
  <tr>
    <td>
       <% $activity %>
    </td>
    <td>
       <% $karma->{$activity} %>
    </td>
  </tr>
% }
</table>

<h2>A few details</h2>
<p>
For a particular contribution type you will only get the points once for each node in the index. For example, if you upload more than one photo for a particular route you will get <% $karma->{'Upload Photo'} %> points in total for all uploaded photos for that route.
</p>
<p>
More than one person can get points for contributions to a particular node in the index.
</p>

<p>
* These may change from time to time.
