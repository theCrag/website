<h2>Introducing Crag Karma</h2>


<p>Crag Karma is a way of thecrag recognising user contributions to the index.
</p>

<p>Every time you contribute to the index, you are helping to build and improve this free online guide for the benefit of the whole climbing community. If altruism is not enough then see <a href="/article/CragCredit">Crag Credit</a> article on how Karma can directly benefit you.
</p>

<p>Karma points are added up across the index to give you a score for each area, up to the World level at the top of the index.
</p>

<p>Each contribution will add to your Karma points. You currently get points for the following: *

% my $karma = $ARGS{data}->{karma};

<table>
% foreach my $activity ( sort {$karma->{$b}<=>$karma->{$a}} keys %{$karma} )   {
  <tr>
    <td>
       <% $activity %>
    </td>
    <td>
       <% $karma->{$activity} %>
    </td>
  </tr>
% }
</table>

<h2>A few details</h2>
<p>
For a particular contribution type you will only get the points once for each node in the index. For example, if you upload more than one photo for a particular route you will get <% $karma->{'Upload Photo'} %> points in total for all uploaded photos for that route.
</p>

<p>
More than one person can get points for contributions to a particular node in the index.
</p>

<p>
Please note that the algorithms are quite involved for assigning karma and because of this there may be cases that we accidently miss assigning karma. If this happens then please contact us so we can fix it for the future, but be aware that we will not be able to back date the karma even if you were entitled to it.
</p>

<p>
* These may change from time to time.
